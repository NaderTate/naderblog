# Nailed it

### My beatiful blog, this is where I post any tutorials / tricks that I find cool.

# Tech Used:

#### Next.JS 14, Sanity, NextUI, Tailwind css, and Typescript.

# Design Principles:

`SOLID`

# Folder Structure:

#### Route groups:

- (users) contains all the public pages
- (admin) contains the Studio dashboard.

#### Components that are used in multiple places are placed in the components folder in the project root.

#### Components that are used in one place only are inside `_components` folder in their route.
